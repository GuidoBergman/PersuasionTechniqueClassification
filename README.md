## Installation

> :warning: A Python version of at least 3.9 is recommended to run this script

It is strongly recommended to create a new virtual environment before installation of any dependencies. This can be done with the following command:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

All dependecies needed to run the module can be installed by running the following command:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

If you want to install dev-only requirements as well, you can additionally run `pip3 install -r requirements-dev.txt`
